# A star Planning Algorithm - Project 2

This is an implementation of A star algorithm with obstacle Space as define in Project 2. See the attached Document.

To run the code:
1) open the folder named Code in matlab.
2) Run pro3.m
3) Give input and output points by clicking the mouse and see the path formed by A-star.
4) Click No or cancel on dialog box after planning is completed to exit or yes to plan again.

Useful Tips:
1) Uncomment Line 47 in addnode to visualize the exploration of nodes.
2)Change resolution in Pro3 line 36 to get different outputs. Less the resolution more optimal the path. (Note that, with increasing resolution more than 2, the visual represenation of nodes explored may slightly go inside the obstacle, but this is only a visual problem in actual, the point is outside the obstacle).
3) See output folder to see some of the already generated paths.
